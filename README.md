# Cards-Mini-Project

In the mini-project i understood the use of following KEY CONCEPTS of css :
1)  position: absolute;  /*not dependent on parent position wise*/
    /* top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%,-50%); */

2)  overflow:hidden  //is basically when an image is contained in a curve box the image border gets cut and fits inside a curved box accordingly
3)   object-fit: cover;   //images fits properly inside the box.
